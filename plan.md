### Team Members: Erik, Atoofa, Kevin

## Task Breakdown and Responsibilities

In this project, the workload is distributed as follows:
- **Kevin**: 50% of the work
- **Erik**: 25% of the work
- **Atoofa**: 25% of the work

Below is a detailed breakdown of the tasks, with each member responsible for different parts of the project.

### 1. Data Collection üß©

**Kevin (50%)**
- Responsible for gathering weather data from [OGD Platform](https://data.gov.in/) and [NICES (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in).
- Handles API requests and downloads datasets in CSV/Excel format.
- Also manages the collection of disease data from [IDSP](https://idsp.nic.in/).
  
**Atoofa (25%)**
- Assists Kevin in aligning weather data with disease outbreak data (matching by region and time).
- Helps with formatting the raw data for further processing.

**Erik (25%)**
- Validates the quality of the collected data, ensuring consistency across regions and time periods.

### 2. Preprocessing üõ†

**Kevin (50%)**
- Leads the data cleaning and preprocessing for both weather and disease datasets.
- Handles missing values, removes outliers, and standardizes the data formats.

**Atoofa (25%)**
- Assists Kevin with data normalization and scaling.
- Works on aggregating daily weather data into weekly or monthly summaries to match disease data.

**Erik (25%)**
- Oversees feature engineering, creating lag variables and temperature anomaly indices to enhance modeling.

---

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîé

**Kevin (50%)**
- Conducts initial exploratory analysis on both weather and disease data.
- Uses descriptive statistics and visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices).

**Atoofa (25%)**
- Focuses on mapping disease spread by region using geographic distribution.
- Visualizes missing data patterns using heatmaps.

**Erik (25%)**
- Develops and tests correlations between weather patterns and disease outbreaks using statistical methods.

---

### 4. Visualization üìä

**Kevin (50%)**
- Responsible for creating the primary visualizations: scatter plots, time series plots, and interactive dashboards.
  
**Atoofa (25%)**
- Assists with creating detailed maps of disease spread using geospatial tools (e.g., GeoPandas).

**Erik (25%)**
- Finalizes and enhances the visualizations, ensuring they are ready for presentation.

---

### 5. Model Development üß†

**Kevin (50%)**
- Develops the predictive model, applying machine learning techniques (e.g., random forest, time series analysis).
  
**Atoofa (25%)**
- Tests different models, helping to optimize accuracy and validate results.

**Erik (25%)**
- Assists with fine-tuning the model and evaluating its performance with test data.

---

### 6. Reporting and Presentation üìù

**Kevin (50%)**
- Compiles the final report, summarizing findings and providing actionable insights for public health authorities.
  
**Atoofa (25%)**
- Creates plogpost material.

**Erik (25%)**
- Reviews the report and presentation for clarity, ensuring all key findings are communicated effectively.

## Project Presentation üé§

As part of the course requirement, Erik and Atoofa will be responsible for delivering the **3-minute spotlight presentation** during Week 42, showcasing the project, its goals, findings, and implications.

- **Spotlight Instructions**: Prepare a 3-minute presentation focusing on the problem, data collection, and key findings. Avoid too many technical details, and focus on communicating effectively to the target audience. Follow additional guidelines provided [here](#).

---

## Deliverables üì¶

The final deliverables include:
1. **Blogpost**: The team will present their results and findings in the form of a blog post, which will communicate the insights in an accessible and engaging way to the public.
   
2. **Technical Report (PDF, max 5 pages)**: A detailed report summarizing the technical aspects of the project, including data collection, preprocessing, visualizations, and modeling techniques.

---

## Assessment Criteria ‚úÖ

- **Presentation**: Clear problem description and communication of results in the spotlight presentation.
- **Value**: The usefulness and relevance of the final deliverable for public health authorities.
- **Effort**: The amount of work and complexity involved in the project.
- **Originality**: How innovative the project idea and solution are.
- **Actionability**: The potential for real-world applications.
- **Project Analysis**: Quality of data wrangling, analysis, and communication of results.
