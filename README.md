# Weather Patterns and Disease Spread in India 🌍

## Motivation 🎯
The aim of this project is to analyze how weather patterns influence the occurrence and spread of diseases such as dengue, malaria, and cholera in India. India's diverse climate, ranging from arid to monsoon-affected regions, offers a unique opportunity to study correlations between weather variables—temperature, rainfall, and humidity—and disease outbreaks. Using open data from sources like the Open Government Data (OGD) Platform and NICES (ISRO), alongside disease data from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP), the project aims to develop predictive models that will help public health authorities optimize resource allocation and interventions.

## Data Collection 🧩
- **Weather Data**: Collected from the [Open Government Data (OGD) Platform](https://data.gov.in/), providing daily and monthly temperature, rainfall, and humidity data across multiple Indian regions. This broad temporal dataset is crucial for identifying long-term trends.
- **Disease Data**: Retrieved from the [Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP)](https://idsp.nic.in/), containing detailed reports on disease outbreaks (dengue, malaria, cholera) at state and district levels, available weekly and annually.

We will align and preprocess these datasets to spot correlations between weather conditions and disease occurrences.

## Preprocessing 🛠
Data cleaning and standardization are essential steps in this phase. We will:
- **Weather Data**: Handle missing values, outliers, and aggregate daily data into weekly or monthly summaries to align with the granularity of disease data.
- **Health Data**: Extract and structure incidence rates for different diseases, ensuring consistency with corresponding weather data by date and region.

Feature engineering will include creating lag variables to capture the delayed effects of weather conditions on disease outbreaks and generating indices such as temperature anomalies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔎
The EDA phase will focus on:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Computing key statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation to understand data distribution and identify outliers.
- **Visualizations**: Leveraging techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns and relationships.

Key areas for exploration include weather variables (temperature, humidity, rainfall) and their correlation with disease outbreaks.

## Visualizations 📊
We will employ the following visualizations:
- **Histograms**: To display the distribution of weather variables and disease cases.
- **Scatter Plots**: To explore relationships between weather variables and disease outbreaks.
- **Time Series Plots**: To observe trends in weather and disease data over time.

These insights will provide a visual understanding of how weather patterns may drive the spread of diseases, assisting in the development of predictive models to guide public health responses.
